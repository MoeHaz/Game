Two important  things in this program so far.

1- location array: in this array I learend taht an array can have (objects{}) and these objects can have (keys and valuses) and (arrys).

2-the second important thing is : the (update function()) the pur  purpose of having is to implement some actions from the location array on other function in the program, meaning instead  of 
having a code body instead each function in the program, we created one function (update()) and we called it in other functions.

I am at step 86, I have finished it
